        <head>Introduction</head>
        <p>This document compiles various concrete use cases implementing the suggested <gi>standOff</gi> element in order to a) identify possible annotation configurations that may be used as
        recommended practices for the corresponding phenomena and b) refine the possible constraints that may bear upon it and its sub-elements. It is based on the experience gained in various
        projects since the initial workshop that took place in <date>January 2014</date> and which launched the definition of this element, as well as on some ongoing activities that are being
        pursued in several national projects in France and Germany (among others), in international institutions (EPO) and in the content of several ISO projects (some of which have already
        been published as standards).</p>
        <p>The major conclusions that can be drawn from these use cases are the following:</p>
        <list>
          <item>There are only two new elements to add to the TEI space: <list>
          <item><gi>standOff</gi>: the general container, designed as a mini-<q><gi>TEI</gi></q> document dedicated to gather all annotation related information for a given annotation
          layer</item>
          <item><gi>listAnnotation</gi>: a list like element within <gi>standOff</gi> to allow various types of groupings for stand-off annotations</item>
          </list></item>
          <item>The content model of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> must be revised to integrate the multiple usage scenarios that have been identified. Basically we need an alternative
          (<gi>choice</gi>) between 2 or 3 possible content models.</item>
        </list>
      </div>
      <div xml:id="OverviewSO">
        <head>Overview of the <gi>standOff</gi> proposal</head>
        <note>This section should be conceived as text that would go in the guidelines</note>
        <p>This proposal implements embedded stand-off annotations, i.e. annotations to an existing document that have the following properties:</p>
        <list>
          <item>Annotations do not alter any part of the document itself, header nor content</item>
          <item>There may be as many complementary and competing annotations attached to a given document as wanted</item>
          <item>Annotations occur at a precisely determined place in the TEI document organisation, namely as an additional resource, child of <gi>TEI</gi> or <gi>teiCorpus</gi>
          <note>We need a scenario for such a usage</note></item>
          <item>Annotations are conveyed with their specific meta-data, to convey information about origin (software, annotators), specific re-use rights, encoding schemes etc.</item>
        </list>
        <div>
          <head>The <gi>standOff</gi> element</head>
          <p>The <gi>standOff</gi> element is the container of any group of coherent annotations attached to a TEI document. Its main characteristics are:</p>
          <list>
            <item>It is attached to the top level of a TEI document by being a member of <code>model.resourceLike</code></item>
            <item>Its content model resembles that of a TEI document by comprising a header (<gi>teiHeader</gi>), additional resources (<code>model.resourceLike</code>) and a content (one or
            several <gi>listAnnotation</gi> elements)</item>
          </list>
          <p>The actual nature of the <gi>standOff</gi> can be further specified by means of two attributes:</p>
          <list>
            <item><att>type</att>: to indicate the general type of annotations which is being represented</item>
            <item><att>notation</att>: to elicit the specific notation used for the corresponding type of annotation in reference to an external standard or a documented practice.</item>
          </list>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element</head>
          <p>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element is a general container allowing one to structure annotations in various subsections. In this respect, its role is analogous to the one played by
          <gi>div</gi> in a general TEI document. Still, <gi>div</gi> could not be taken up here in order to be able to keep to a very restrained content model.</p>
          <p>As an iterative and recursive element, <gi>listAnnotation</gi> can be typed to indicate the organisational logic of the annotations (e.g. per annotation layer, per annotator, per annotation objects in the case of NER).</p>
          <p>The <gi>listAnnotation</gi> element is also structured like other listXXX elements so that it may start with <code>model.headLike</code> members (e.g. <gi>head</gi>).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Updating the <gi>annotationBlock</gi> element</head>
          <p>The <gi>annotationBlock</gi> was initially conceived as a construct with a dual role for the inline and stand-off annotation of textual content. For the sake of having it quickly
          inserted in the TEI guidelines, only a limited range of usages has been documented so far.</p>
          <p>In the stand-off annotation proposal, <gi>annotationBlock</gi> takes a major role as the container for elementary annotations.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Taking up existing annotations mechanisms from the TEI vocabulary</head>
          <p>The TEI guidelines has a wide variety of elements to implement elementary mechanisms for stand-off annotation. The purpose of this document is to provide more precise guidance as to how to combine them and
          identify their complementarities. As this stage we can characterised these elements as follows:</p>
          <list>
            <item><gi>span</gi> is a general purpose element to point to a location or a sequence in a document and ideal to cover the general notion of <mentioned>markable</mentioned> in the
            linguistic annotation literature.</item>
            <item><gi>zone</gi>, which can be seen as playing a similar role to <gi>span</gi> in the case of images</item>
            <item><gi>interp</gi>, which currently has a narrow scope in the TEI guidelines but offers the possibilities to connect annotated passages (<att>inst</att>) with annotation content
            (<att>ana</att>)</item>
          </list>
        </div>
        <div>
          <head>Linking components</head>
          <p><gi>link</gi>... [To be discussed when we are far enough with the rest: specific role of <gi>link</gi> for annotations, integration in the content model of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> etc.]</p>

          <head>Quick presentation of the Web Annotation Data Model</head>
          <p>The <ref target="#WADM">Web Annotation Data Model</ref> (WADM) articulates around three complementary components:</p>
          <list>
            <item>Target: that identifies one or several <mentioned>resources</mentioned> about which something is said </item>
            <item>Body: that contains what is said about the resource</item>
            <item>Annotation: that links one or several targets with 0-n bodies</item>
          </list>
          <p>This model decouples resources and what is said about them by means of the <mentioned>annotation</mentioned> component. It is highly flexible and powerful since it allows one to associated as many targets with as many bodies as needed.</p>
          <p>It is suggested that the Open Annotation model could be implemented as in the <gi>standOff</gi> construct follows:</p>
          <list>
            <item><p>The <mentioned>Target</mentioned> component could be implement with either <gi>span</gi> for textual targets or <gi>zone</gi> when pointing to an image.</p>

            </item>
            <item>
              <p>The <mentioned>Body</mentioned> component can be implemented by means of a wide variety of elements depending on the various use cases that we describe here.</p>
              <note place="inline">See the proposed implementation of <gi>annotationBlock</gi>: we suggest to introduce a class <code>model.OABody</code></note>
            </item>
            <item><p>The <mentioned>Annotation</mentioned> component is implemented by means of the <gi>interp</gi> element complemented with the three following attributes:</p>
            <list>
              <item><att>type</att>: to indicate the type of the annotation (e.g. <q>quantity</q>, <q>person</q>, etc.)</item>
              <item><att>inst</att>: points to one or more <gi>span</gi> elements (possibly in the same <gi>annotationBlock</gi> when appropriate</item>
              <item><att>ana</att>: points to the actual content of the annotation, depending on the annotation scheme. In simple cases, these could be <gi>note</gi> (see below) or
              <gi>fs</gi> elements.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Additional elements could probably be used here, but we should provide univocal guidance for such a use case, in order to avoid content model ambiguities and in general too
            much heterogeneous implementations of the WADM model.</p>

          <div>
            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Named entity recognition is a typical use case for stand-off annotation. It is usually based upon an automatic analysis process of a digital text which produces various hypotheses
            as to which entities (persons, events, organisations, dates, etc.) are actually mentioned. Given the variety of possible hypotheses, and the quantity of information that a NER
            module may produce, it does not make sense in putting the resulting annotation inline. Besides, there is a need to record some specific metadata related to the NER process such as
            the tool that has been used, the parameters given to the tool, etc.</p>
            <p>The idea here is to contribute to the definition of a standardised output interface for NER components or online services so that such annotations can actually be re-used,
            compared, visualised in a systematic way.</p>

            <p>NER annotations are usually organised according to the type of recognised entities. This facilitates the further filtering of the output of a NER Process when a user only needs a

              <quote>The Holocaust (from the Greek ὁλόκαυστος holókaustos: hólos, "whole" and kaustós, "burnt"),[2] also known as the Shoah (Hebrew: השואה, HaShoah, "the catastrophe"), was a
              genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews.[3] The victims included 1.5 million children[4] and represented about
              two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe.[5] Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders,
              bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany and German-occupied territories.[6] From 1941 to 1945, Jews were systematically murdered in
              one of the deadliest genocides in history, which was part of a broader aggregate of acts of oppression and killings of various ethnic and political groups in Europe by the Nazi
              regime.[7] Every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics and the carrying out of the genocide. Other victims of Nazi crimes included ethnic Poles, Soviet
              citizens and Soviet POWs, other Slavs, Romanis, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and the mentally and physically disabled.[8][9] A network of about 42,500
              facilities in Germany and German-occupied territories was used to concentrate victims for slave labor, mass murder, and other human rights abuses.[10] Over 200,000 people are
              estimated to have been Holocaust perpetrators.[11] The persecution and genocide were carried out in stages, culminating in what Nazis termed the "Final Solution to the Jewish
              Question" (die Endlösung der Judenfrage), an agenda to exterminate Jews in Europe. Initially the German government passed laws to exclude Jews from civil society, most
              prominently the Nuremberg Laws of 1935. Nazis established a network of concentration camps starting in 1933 and ghettos following the outbreak of World War II in 1939. In 1941,
              as Germany conquered new territory in eastern Europe, specialized paramilitary units called Einsatzgruppen murdered around two million Jews and "partisans",[clarification
              needed] often in mass shootings. By the end of 1942, victims were being regularly transported by freight trains to extermination camps where, if they survived the journey, most
              were systematically killed in gas chambers. This continued until the end of World War II in Europe in April–May 1945.Jewish armed resistance was limited. The most notable
              exception was the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943, when thousands of poorly-armed Jewish fighters held the Waffen-SS at bay for four weeks. An estimated 20–30,000 Jewish
              partisans actively fought against the Nazis and their collaborators in Eastern Europe.[12][13] French Jews took part in the French Resistance, which conducted a guerilla
              campaign against the Nazis and Vichy French authorities. Over a hundred armed Jewish uprisings took place.[14]</quote>

        <p>In this use case, we make the assumption that the text is tokenized inline by means of <gi>w</gi> elements as follows, with each token being associated to a unique identifier by means
        of an <att>xml:id</att> attribute:</p>
        <egXML n="07" xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
          <text>
            <body> ... <p>
            <w xml:id="w1">I</w>
            <w xml:id="w2">wanna</w>
            <w xml:id="w3">put</w>
            <w xml:id="w4">up</w>

            <w xml:id="w6">wallpaper</w>
            <pc>.</pc>
            </p> ... </body>
          </text>
        </egXML>

        <p>In conformance to <ref target="#ISO24611">ISO 24611 (MAF)</ref>, word forms are represented by <gi>span</gi> elements, pointing to the corresponding token(s) in the source text (see the
        note below concerning the use of the proper attributes). The actual analysis of the word form is provided by means of a feature-structure referred to from the <gi>span</gi> element by
        means of an <att>ana</att> attribute. The additional <att>corresp</att> attribute allows one to point to the lexical entries equivalent to the word form, when one links the
        morpho-syntactic annotation to a reference lexicon.</p>

        <note>This representation is not conformant to the WADM model. In some way, the <gi>span</gi> element combines both roles of <mentioned>target</mentioned> and
        <mentioned>annotation</mentioned> classes from WADM. The actual <mentioned>body</mentioned> is made of both the feature structure and the lexical entry that are being pointing to.</note>
        <note>To be checked: should we use <att>from</att> and <att>to</att> instead of <att>target</att> here.</note>

        <p>The initial model for <gi>annotationBlock</gi> was conceived to represent the traditional notion of interlinear annotation that one finds, among others, in the field linguistic domain.

          <head>The baseline</head>
          <p>In the initial proposal, the content model of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> was limited to a plain and flat class, <code>model.annotation</code>, with the following constraints added to
          the elements that one would want to use fro annotaiton purposes (whether as source, annotation or body in the WADM):</p>
          <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
            <classRef key="model.annotation" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          </egXML>
          <p>The major difficulty with this is that there is no way to constraint that one would want to use specific elements as source, annotation or body.</p>
          <p>Suggestion has been made (LB, I think) that such a class should better be called <code>model.annotationBlockPart</code></p>

          <p>The first constraint bearing upon the content model of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> is to ensure the continuity with the its initial definition and to allow a stand-off verion of
          interlinear <q>Partitur</q> annotation.</p>

          <p>In order to differentiate between the different encoding variants we have identified, the <gi>annotationBlock</gi> element must be associated to a <att>notation</att> attribute <note
          place="inline">Could also be <att>mode</att></note> which can take one of the following values:</p>
          <list>
            <item><code>inSitu</code>: non stand-off usage of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> as documented in the <title>Transcriptions of speech</title> chapter.</item>
            <item><code>exSitu</code>: equivalent to the <code>inSitu</code> case in stand-off mode</item>
            <item><code>WADM</code>: Open Annotation compliant model (Target, Body, Annotation)</item>
          </list>
        </div>
        <note>A simplification of the annotation model may consist in adding <att>inst</att> to <gi>annotationBlock</gi>, with the semantics that <gi>annotationBlock</gi> +is+ the annotation level
        (in the sense of WADM), the target being expressed by the <att>inst</att> and the content of <gi>annotationBlock</gi> is the body level. From an implementation point of view, this would
        mean adding <gi>annotationBlock</gi> to <code>att.interpLike</code>.</note>

        <p>Should we document the importance of typing <gi>span</gi> to indicate the granularity of the object that is being referred to?</p>
        <p><gi>interp</gi> must also be typed, with inheritance mechanisms from <gi>annotationBlock</gi></p>
        <p>Shall we use <gi>specDesc</gi> to implement annotation crystals?</p>
